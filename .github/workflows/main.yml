      # Cache build and external artifacts so that the next ci build is incremental.
      # Because github action caches cannot be updated after a build, we need to
      # store the contents of each build in a unique cache key, then fall back to loading
      # it on the next ci run. We use hashFiles(...) in the key and restore-keys- with
      # the prefix to load the most recent cache for the branch on a cache miss. You
      # should customize the contents of hashFiles to capture any bazel input sources,
      # although this doesn't need to be perfect. If none of the input sources change
      # then a cache hit will load an existing cache and bazel won't have to do any work.
      # In the case of a cache miss, you want the fallback cache to contain most of the
      # previously built artifacts to minimize build time. The more precise you are with
      # hashFiles sources the less work bazel will have to do.
